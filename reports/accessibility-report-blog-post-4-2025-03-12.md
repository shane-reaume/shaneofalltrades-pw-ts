## Recommendations

### Color Contrast

- Increase the contrast between text and background colors
- Use a color contrast checker tool to verify your color choices
- Consider using darker text on light backgrounds or lighter text on dark backgrounds

### ARIA and Landmarks

- Add appropriate landmark roles to your content (e.g., `<header role="banner">`, `<main role="main">`)
- Ensure ARIA attributes are used correctly
- Verify that ARIA IDs are unique and reference existing elements

### Images

- Add alt text to all images (descriptive for content images, empty for decorative images)
- Ensure complex images have extended descriptions
- Check that icon fonts have appropriate text alternatives

### Document Structure

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Ensure proper heading levels and hierarchy
- Fix list structure issues by ensuring correct nesting

### Other Issues

- Review each violation and the associated helpUrl for specific guidance
- Consider conducting manual keyboard and screen reader testing
- Update your testing processes to include accessibility checks early in development
