- Ensure ARIA attributes are used correctly
- Verify that ARIA IDs are unique and reference existing elements

- Ensure proper heading levels and hierarchy
- Fix list structure issues by ensuring correct nesting

### Other Issues

- Review each violation and the associated helpUrl for specific guidance
